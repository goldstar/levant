Levant is an open source templating and deployment tool for [HashiCorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) jobs that provides realtime feedback and detailed failure messages upon deployment issues.

## Features

* **Realtime Feedback**: Using watchers, Levant provides realtime feedback on Nomad job deployments allowing for greater insight and knowledge about application deployments.

* **Advanced Job Status Checking**: Particulary for system and batch jobs, Levant will ensure the job, evaluations and allocations all reach the desired state providing feedback at every stage.

* **Dynamic Job Group Counts**: If the Nomad job is currently running on the cluster, Levant will dynamically update the rendered template with the relevant job group counts before deployment.

* **Failure Inspection**: Upon a deployment failure, Levant will inspect each allocation and log information about each event, providing useful information for debugging without the need for querying the cluster retrospectively.

* **Canary Auto Promotion**: In environments with advanced automation and alerting, automatic promotion of canary deployments may be desirable after a certain time threshold. Levant allows the user to specify a `canary-auto-promote` time period, which if reached with a healthy set of canaries, will automatically promote the deployment.

* **Multiple Variable File Formats**: Currently Levant supports `.json`, `.tf`, `.yaml`, and `.yml` file extensions for the declaration of template variables.

* **Auto Revert Checking**: In the event that a job deployment does not pass its healthy threshold and the job has auto-revert enabled; Levant will track the resulting rollback deployment so you can see the exact outcome of the deployment process.
